## About [↑](#Contents-)

Q-stack is a stack of codes for dedicated pre- and post-processing tasks for Quantum Machine Learning (QML). It is a work in progress, and will be updated soon.

For now, we link to the relevant packages that will be incorporated (among others):
- https://github.com/lcmd-epfl/azo-xcite-tools
- https://github.com/lcmd-epfl/SPAHM
- https://github.com/lcmd-epfl/RHO-Decomposition
- https://github.com/lcmd-epfl/ml-density
- https://github.com/lcmd-epfl/OTPD-basis

Stay tuned for updates!
